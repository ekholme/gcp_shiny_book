# Cloud Build & Artifact Registry

This chapter provides an overview of Cloud Build and Artifact Registry, which we'll use to build and store our container.

**Misc**

- mention cloudbuild.yaml setup
- mention CI/CD
- sort of misc note that cloud build doesn't cache builds, so each time you build it is "from scratch"
