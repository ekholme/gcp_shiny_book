    "text": "Welcome to Deploying Shiny with Google Cloud! This book – well, booklet, really – is meant to help R users and shiny developers deploy applications using Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Although there are several “hello world” type blog posts out there describing how to deploy an “Old Faithful” shiny app via GCP, there aren’t as many that describe how to deploy apps that align with real-world needs, such as connecting your app to a Cloud SQL database, managing secrets, and securing the application.\nThis booklet is my attempt to fill that gap and provide an end-to-end example that uses several GCP services to run a {shiny} app that more closely aligns with what developers might hope to actually deploy. This isn’t to say we’re building a production-grade app here (we are emphatically not), but rather that this book will highlight features that you will use in production apps that typically aren’t discussed in the “hello world” tutorials.\nFor the most part, I’ll illustrate this process using the GCP console, which is the graphical user interface (GUI) through which users can configure GCP services and whatnot. That said, there will be some cases in which I use the command line and the gcloud SDK or other command line interfaces (CLIs, e.g. psql). When this is the case, I’ll try to describe why I’m opting for the CLI over the console.\nOne caveat of the above is that the Google can change the appearance of the console, so it’s possible that the screenshots in this book aren’t perfectly representative of the current console, but they’re likely close enough.\nPerhaps obviously, this book includes R code. Additionally, it also includes a smattering of supplemental code that is necessary to get your app up and running, such as configurations within Dockerfiles or YAML files. My assumption is that people reading this book are mostly familiar with R, and have some familiarity with YAML in the context of Rmarkdown documents, so I’ll be more explicit in describing the content of non-R code and what it’s doing."

These are things that are useful to know but are beyond the scope of this book. Here are some things this book won’t cover:\n\nImproving your shiny app development skills. If you want to learn more about shiny, your best bet is Mastering Shiny by Hadley Wickham. If you’re into videos, you might also check out the Shiny Developer Series videos by Eric Nantz.\nWriting production-grade shiny apps. There’s a better book out there by Colin Fay\nDatabase administration. We’ll spin up a small sample database that we’ll connect our app to for illustration purposes, but in the real world, you’ll likely need to manage your database. Although many of Google’s database products are managed in the sense that they handle maintaining, provisioning, etc. for you, you do still need to pay attention to them. I’m not a database admnistrator, so this is outside of my expertise. If you’re building a production app for your organization, you’ll want to bring in someone that knows about databases.\nAdvanced Docker. Docker is super cool and powerful. It can do a lot. We’re using it to containerize an app, and we’re leveraging images provided by the Rocker Project to do so. We’re going to leave most of the functionality of Docker untouched."

Shiny apps can be many things, but they’re often dashboards or some other style of tool for interacting with data and/or statistical models. When describing them, I’m mostly going to assume you’re making a dashboard. One of the nice features of shiny is that you can build these apps purely with R code – you don’t need to know HTML, CSS, Javascript, or any other backend language like Go or Rust or Python. Knowing some HTML/CSS/Javascript can be helpful if you want to extend your shiny app, but they’re not necessary.\nAnother nice feature of shiny is that, since it’s built using R code, it interacts nicely with other R code. This means we can do things like work with dataframes and model objects easily without having to worry about translating these things into objects that other languages can understand. It also means we can prototype apps fairly quickly."

    "text": "2.2 Components of a Shiny App\nAt a very broad level, shiny apps consist of two components: a user interface (UI) and a server (there’s no acronym for server, just FYI).\n\n2.2.1 UI\nLike its name suggests, the UI is how users interact (or interface) with your application. It usually consists of input devices (dropdowns, sliders, open text, etc) and output displays (e.g. tables, graphs, text) arranged in a way that’s hopefully appealing and navigable. The inputs of the UI are (always? almost always?) parameters that get passed to functions in the server, and the outputs in the UI are the results of functions executed by the server.\n\n\n2.2.2 Server\nThe server is where the logic of your code gets executed. Its job is to wrap together several functions that take inputs from the UI (as well as inputs not defined in the UI), pass them into functions, and then pass the results of these functions back to the UI to display as outputs. Moreso than the UI, the server is reminiscent of “typical” R code. The server is where you’ll predict from models, create plots, query databases, etc."

A very simple (but not entirely correct) way to think of GCP is that it’s basically a bunch of specialized computers that you can pay to use, and these specialized computers can do different things. GCP offers services including compute (e.g. virtual machines, Kubernetes Engine, Cloud Run), databases (e.g. CloudSQL, Firestore, BigQuery), machine learning (e.g. Vertex AI), CI/CD (e.g. Cloud Build), and more. Given how large and ubiquitous of a company Google is, and given that they’re a leader in the tech industry, it’s probably not surprising that GCP can do pretty much anything you can think up.\nIt is well beyond the scope of this little booklet to delve into all of the features of GCP. Actually, it’s beyond the scope of this booklet to fully cover even the services we are going to use. So if you’re interested in learning more about GCP, there are lots of avenues you might pursue.

Another key feature of Cloud Run is that it runs containerized applications, and as a result can run pretty much anything you want it to, including shiny apps. We’ll get into more details later on, but one caveat of Cloud Run that I’ll mention right now is that it’s intended to run stateless applications. Shiny applications are inherently stateful, so there’s a bit of friction here. There are a few ways to address this limitation, which we’ll dive into later on, but it’s worth mentioning at the outset that, for some use cases, this might make Cloud Run a nonstarter."
